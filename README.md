I am currently in the process of learning Python 3. My first project will be to create a clone of Notepad++ from scratch, in Python.
I will start by creating a clone of Windows Notepad. Once I am comfortable and confident in creating it I will add new features over time.

The goal of this project is to get into the mindset of creating a project from scratch without the help of tutorials or step by step 
instructions. 

Why a Notepad clone? Because it seems a simple enought project for a beginner, without being too overwhelming. I feel it's a great exercise
in learning all that goes into creating a program from start to production.
